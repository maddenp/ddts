3.1

Log user-specified directory arguments to gen-baseline and use-baseline options.
Fix a typo in a log message.

3.0

Changed app/configs to app/defs to align with DDTS design terminology. Changed
references to 'config' to 'definition' in documentation and comments.

Removed 'show [builds|runs|suites]' commands, as these show definition fragments
that are not buildable or runnable. Users need to know via other means which
suites are defined for their use. The 'show suite' command, with a valid suite
name as its argument, will show a list of runnable runs, and 'show run' will
show buildable builds. The 'show [builds|runs|suites' commands would only have
been useful to application developers, and they can use 'ls' to achieve the same
goal (i.e. they must already be aware of the directory structure under app/defs.

Changed lib_run* rooutine arguments lists to align with lib_build* routines',
and replaced 'rundir' argument to lib_run* routines with env.run.ddts_root. See
the README for more information.

Renamed reserved definition keys with a 'ddts_' prefix, to avoid conflicts. For
example, 'extends' becomes 'ddts_extends'. See the README for more information.

Added ability, via !delete YAML tag, to delete an inherited array entry.

2.4

Add support for YAML tag !delete, to suppress inheritance of a key.

2.3

Fix a bug related to baseline generation. Replace a use of Object#method with
Object#send to allow method_missing handling. Restore Unquoted#initialize.

2.2

Add support for 'lib_comp' setting in run configs, for specifying alternate
comparators on a per-run basis.

2.1

Add support for YAML tag !replace (see README), and add sanity check for run
configs with missing or invalid 'build' keys.

2.0

Change env.suite._runs object to always provide .failed, .files and .result
members, which allows propagation of information from even failed runs to
post-processing methods like lib_suite_post. Add env.suite._builds object.

1.2

Make 'baseline' key in run configs optional.

1.1

Added support for run dependencies.
 
1.0

Initial release.
